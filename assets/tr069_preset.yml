# TR069 The default description format is the standard YAML format, which can facilitate the use of various data structures. For example, a set of presets can be used to complete the automatic initialization of new devices online

#	- oid  Can be set in scripts, factory settings, firmware configuration
#	- enabled Indicates whether to enable this task
#	- delay  For download tasks, the CPE can be delayed
#	- onfail  If it is defined as cancel, when the task fails, all unexecuted tasks defined by the description file will be canceled; when defined as ignore, unexecuted tasks will continue to be executed

# The order of execution is  FactoryresetConfig -> FirmwareConfig -> Downloads ->Uploads -> SetParameterValues -> GetParameterNames,
# In a set of preset tasks, only some operations can be set, if the preset is executed by the system scheduled task,
# factoryreset, firmwareconfig will be ignored


# Factory settings script description, single definition
FactoryResetConfig:
  oid: "test_factory_reset_cfg"
  enabled: false
  delay: 0
  onfail: "ignore"

# Firmware configuration description
FirmwareConfig:
  oid: "test_firmware_cfg"
  enabled: false
  delay: 0
  onfail: "ignore"

# Regular download script, supports multiple sequential execution
Downloads:
  - oid: "test_download"
    enabled: true
    delay: 0
    onfail: "ignore"
  - oid: "test_download2"
    enabled: true
    delay: 0
    onfail: "ignore"

# Regular upload tasks that support multiple sequential executions
Uploads:
  - filetype: "2 VendorLog File"
    enabled: false
    onfail: "ignore"

# Set parameters, send multiple sets of parameters at one time
SetParameterValues:
  - name: "Device.DeviceInfo.X_MIKROTIK_SystemIdentity"
    type: "string"
    value: "TestRos"

# Get parameters, support multiple sequential execution
GetParameterValues:
  - "Device.DeviceInfo."
